# Changelog

## 1.0.10

-- Updated syntax for running tests with selenium webdriver. New syntax: `venus run -t spec.js --selenium grid_url --browser chrome|20.0`
-- Changed test urls to use system IP address instead of hostname. Can manually set hostname with either `--hostname` command line flag, or `hostname: 'myhost'` property in config file
-- Fixed bug which prevented mocha tests from running on IE

## 1.0.2

- New demo mode: `venus demo`. This will run a sample test, with phantomjs and code coverage enabled.
